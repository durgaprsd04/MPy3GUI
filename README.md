MPy3GUI
=======
## General Outlines
A simple program intended as a wrapper for some python code. Mostly done using
tkinter and using ttk class for a better appearance. Pretty bad part with the
coding. Improvements include

<li> Splitting the code to several parts
<li> Adding warnings and implied actions.
<li> Adding keybindings.
<li> Making it efficient in terms of work done.

## Dependencies
Code demands several dependencies to be met.
<li> A working tkinter installation.
<li> ffmpeg
<li> ffmpeg thumbnailer as it will be used in the future applications.
<li> VLC or mplayer according to the users choice. Mostly this will be dropped
and any suitable video player might be added.
