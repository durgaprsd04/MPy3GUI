MPy3GUI
=======
## General Outlines
A simple program intended as a wrapper for some python code. Mostly done using
tkinter and using ttk class for a better appearance. Pretty bad part with the
coding. Improvements include

* Splitting the code to several parts 
* Adding warnings and implied actions.
* Adding keybindings.
* Making it efficient in terms of work done.

## Dependencies
Code demands several dependencies to be met.
* A working tkinter installation.
* ffmpeg
* ffmpeg thumbnailer as it will be used in the future applications.
* VLC or mplayer according to the users choice. Mostly this will be dropped
and any suitable video player might be added.
